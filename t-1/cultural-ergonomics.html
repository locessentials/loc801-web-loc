                            <strong>Nancy Tsai's article "Cultural ergonomics in localization: Engineering a more inclusive language product"</strong> demonstrates what happens when localization becomes a superficial rubber-stamping activity. Through her analysis of security questions on Canadian and U.S. websites (such as "What is your favorite pizza topping?" or "What was the first concert you attended?"), Tsai shows how these questions assume specific cultural experiences that don't apply to immigrant users or those from different countries or socioeconomic backgrounds.

                            As you read this article, notice the importance of designing for real users, not imagined ones. In this lesson we consider why this is fair and necessary for the user. Later in the course, when we study SEO, you'll learn why good UX design also benefits organizations and groups who produce websites.

                            <p class="resource-content">
                                Tsai analyzes security questions like "What is your favorite pizza topping?" or "What was the first concert you attended?" that are perfectly translated into the target language but completely disconnected from many users' experiences.

                            <p class="resource-content">
                                What has gone wrong in the localization process when a translation is linguistically correct but culturally inappropriate? Why is it not enough to simply translate words from one language to another? Use examples from Tsai's article and, if you can, your own experiences navigating websites.

                            <h3 class="resource-title">Who are we really designing for?</h3>
                            <p class="resource-content">
                                Tsai argues that security questions on websites assume a specific user: white, English-speaking, middle-class, heteronormative, suburban. Canada, however, has an immigrant population representing 20.7% (2011) and projected to reach 30% by 2036. The United States has nearly 48 million immigrants (2022).

                                If websites are designed to serve the entire population, why do you think they continue to reflect the experiences of a specific demographic? What would need to change in the web development process for sites to be truly inclusive? Consider both technical aspects and human/organizational aspects.

                                Tsai proposes the concept of "cultural ergonomics" and suggests two solutions: (1) allow users to create their own security questions, and (2) incorporate sensitivity reading into the translation workflow.

                                As a future localization professional, how could you implement these concepts in your work?
