                            Key Takeaways
                        </h2>
                        <ul class="objectives-list">
                            <li class="objective-item">Translation quality directly affects how well your localized website performs in search — content that reads naturally and authentically to native speakers is ranked and cited more reliably by both search engines and AI systems</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">The ASTM F43 committee has defined two translation quality labels: Unverified Translation (UVT) for content that has not been reviewed by a qualified professional, and Professionally Verified Translation (PVT) for content that has</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">Being bilingual is not the same as being a professional translator — professional translators bring specialized proficiency across seven areas: source and target language, translation technique, subject matter, audience appropriateness, technology, specifications, and business practices</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">Machine translation is a legitimate part of many professional workflows, but the defining factor is professional oversight: using machine translation output without qualified review produces UVT, not PVT</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">Evaluating a translator across the seven proficiency areas gives you a structured, replicable way to assess whether someone is genuinely qualified for your specific project</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">A translator's portfolio and references should demonstrate not just that they translate, but that their translations read naturally and perform well in the target market</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">Translation agencies — also called language service companies (LSCs) — can offer scalability, project management, and access to specialists, but not all agencies are equally well suited for website localization work</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">One of the most important questions to ask any agency is whether they will assign a dedicated, consistent team to your project — voice and terminology consistency across a website depend on it</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools can be valuable for technical content but introduce real risks for website copy, where natural-sounding, contextually coherent language directly affects both user experience and SEO performance</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">An agency's real value should extend beyond task assignment — strong agency partners bring expertise in SEO localization, cultural adaptation, and web-specific quality assurance</li>
                            <li class="objective-item">Marketing claims and actual practices don't always align — the only way to know how a translator or agency truly operates is to ask direct, specific questions about their workflows, tools, and quality control processes</li>

                                    Find a multilingual website you use or encounter regularly and compare the same page in two languages. Does the non-English version read naturally? Can you spot signs of machine translation without professional review — awkward phrasing, inconsistent terminology, or sentences that feel translated rather than written? Based on what you've learned in this topic, would you classify the translation as UVT or PVT, and why?

                                    Find a translator or translation agency that looks strong on paper — a polished website, impressive credentials, convincing testimonials. Then reach out and ask them a few direct questions about how they actually work: Do they use CAT tools for website copy, and how do they handle the loss of context that comes with segment-by-segment translation? How do they ensure consistency of voice across a website? What does their quality control process look like for a web localization project? What you hear — or don't hear — will tell you far more than their marketing materials ever could.

Would you recommend hiring an individual translator or working with an agency? What factors would tip the decision one way or the other? How would the size of the project, the number of target languages, and the importance of brand voice factor into that choice?

                            You've now developed a framework for evaluating the human professionals who make web localization possible. Combined with the technical and content skills from earlier topics, you're building a well-rounded foundation for real-world localization work.

                                In Topic 7, you'll explore the translation technology landscape and develop a framework for making informed decisions about which tools are right for a given project. You'll examine the implications of using computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools for web localization, work through a Translation Technology Scorecard to evaluate your options systematically, and get hands-on experience localizing web content using a CAT tool. This topic bridges your understanding of human translator selection with the practical tools and technologies that professional localization workflows rely on.

                                If you reached out to a translator or agency as part of the reflection exercise above, take note of what you learned — not just about that specific professional, but about what questions to ask and what answers to look for. The habit of verifying claims against actual practice is one of the most valuable skills you can bring to any localization project.
