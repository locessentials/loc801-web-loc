                        </h2>
                        <p class="intro-text">
                            In the previous page, we covered what to look for when hiring an individual translator. But for many website owners, especially those localizing into multiple languages or who don't have time to manage individual freelancers directly, working with a translation agency — also called a Language Service Company, or LSC — is the more practical choice.
                        </p>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            An LSC can offer scalability, project management, and access to specialists you couldn't easily hire on your own: SEO professionals, UX writers, desktop publishing experts, and more. That breadth of expertise can be genuinely valuable when localizing a website, where translation is only one piece of the puzzle.
                        </p>
                        <p class="conclusion-text">
                            However, not all agencies are built the same. Understanding what separates a strategically valuable agency partner from one that's simply brokering cheap labor is critical before you sign a contract.

                            Dedicated Teams vs. Whoever Is Available
                        </h2>
                        <p class="intro-text">
                            One of the most important questions to ask any agency is whether they will assign a dedicated, consistent team to your project — or whether they assign work to whichever translator happens to be available and willing to work at the lowest rate.
                        </p>
                        <p class="conclusion-text" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            This distinction matters enormously for website localization. A website isn't a collection of isolated documents. It's a living ecosystem of pages, blog posts, product descriptions, and UI copy that all need to sound like they come from the same voice. When different translators handle different pages — or even different sections of the same page — without coordinating with the other writers, the result is a patchwork of styles, inconsistent terminology, and tonal shifts that readers notice even if they can't articulate why.

                                Ask the agency directly: "How do you assign translators to client projects?" The answer will tell you a lot. An agency that describes a careful matching process — considering subject matter expertise, prior experience with your industry, and cultural fit — is very different from one that describes a system that automatically routes work to whoever is currently available at the lowest price point.

                            The CAT Tool Question
                        </h2>
                        <p class="intro-text">
                            Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools are widely used in the translation industry. For technical documentation, software strings, and other content where precision and consistency are paramount, CAT tools can be a good fit. But website copy is a different kind of content — and defaulting to CAT tools for all of it can actually work against your SEO and discoverability goals.
                        </p>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            CAT tools work by breaking a document into segments — typically individual sentences — and translating each one in isolation, drawing on translation memory databases. The problem is that compelling website copy rarely lives sentence by sentence. A homepage headline, a product description, a brand story: these are pieces of writing where rhythm, flow, and cumulative effect matter. Translating them in fragments produces technically accurate output that reads as exactly what it is — stitched-together segments rather than coherent writing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="conclusion-text" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            Search engines and AI systems have gotten quite good at detecting whether content reads naturally to a native speaker. Content that was reassembled from segmented translation memory matches tends to underperform in search — and loses real readers when they land on the page.
                        </p>

                            <div class="how-to-use-text">
                                <strong>Ask any agency whether they use CAT tools for all content by default</strong>, and whether translators are given the freedom to depart from translation memory suggestions when a more natural rendering would serve the text better. A good agency will have a clear answer. An agency that treats CAT tool output as final without professional editorial judgment is not a good fit for web localization work.

                            An agency's real value proposition should be clear when you ask this question directly: <em>Beyond connecting me with translators, what do you bring to a web localization project?</em>

                        <p class="conclusion-text" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                            The strongest agencies bring expertise that goes well beyond translation. For website localization specifically, this might include SEO specialists who can advise on keyword strategy for the target language market, UX writers who understand how copy needs to adapt for different screen contexts, or project managers with genuine web localization experience who can flag issues before they become expensive problems. For someone building a localized version of their website without an in-house team, access to these specializations through a single agency relationship can be genuinely worthwhile.
                        </p>

                            <strong>The minimum bar:</strong> Even if an agency doesn't offer SEO or UX services, they should at minimum be running a transparent communication process. Your translators will have questions and recommendations — about terminology choices, cultural adaptations, content that doesn't land in the target language. How does the agency ensure those insights reach you? An agency that absorbs translator feedback internally without ever surfacing it to the client is not serving you well, regardless of the quality of their translators.

                            Not every agency that offers translation services is a good fit for website localization. Some function primarily as automated brokerage systems: work comes in, gets routed to the lowest-cost available translator, and the output goes back out with little editorial oversight or client communication in between.

                            This model can work for high-volume, low-stakes content where speed and cost efficiency matter more than voice and SEO performance. But for a localized website — where every page is a potential first impression for a new audience — it's not a strategic choice.

                                <strong>Watch for these warning signs:</strong> Vague answers about translator selection; a workflow that routes work automatically without human judgment; no mention of glossaries, style guides, or brand voice; translation memory match rates presented as a quality metric; and an inability to explain how translator feedback reaches the client. Any one of these should prompt further questions. Several of them together suggest the agency is not the right partner for this kind of work.

                            Working with a translation agency can be the right move for a website localization project — but only if the agency is genuinely adding value. The questions in this page give you a framework for assessing whether an agency has the people, practices, and communication processes to serve your project well.

                            The Loc300 course goes deeper on agency selection, including a full Vendor Management Scorecard that walks through the relationship between agencies and their translators in detail. If you're planning to work with an agency for a significant localization project, we recommend working through that material.
