                            In the previous topic, we learned that the words on your website matter — not just to your readers, but to how search engines and AI systems understand and surface your content. For a localized website to perform well in search, the content in each language needs to be coherent, natural, and genuinely useful to readers of that language. A Spanish-speaking user searching for your services uses different vocabulary, different phrasing, and different search patterns than an English-speaking one. Your localized content has to meet them where they are.

                        <p class="regular-text">
                            That's why who produces your translation matters just as much as the translation itself. A translation that is technically accurate but awkward, unnatural, or culturally off will underperform in search — and will lose the readers who do find it.

                            The ASTM F43 committee — an international standards body dedicated to translation and interpretation — has developed two labels to help buyers and readers understand what kind of translation they are looking at.

                            <p class="resource-content">
                                Translation that has not been professionally verified. This includes raw machine translation output — from systems like Google Translate, DeepL, or LLMs — as well as translations produced by bilingual individuals who are not professionally qualified translators. The defining feature of UVT is the absence of professional oversight, not necessarily how it was produced.

                                Translation that has been verified by a qualified professional — regardless of whether automated tools were used in the drafting process. The defining feature of PVT is professional oversight. A translator can use machine translation as a starting draft and still deliver PVT, as long as they have reviewed, corrected, and verified the output.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p class="conclusion-text">
                            For website localization, PVT should be your goal. Search engines and AI systems evaluate not just whether a page exists in a language, but whether the content reads naturally and serves the needs of real readers in that language. Professionally verified translation is far more likely to clear that bar.

                            What About Machine Translation?
                        </h2>
                        <p class="intro-text">
                            Machine translation tools have improved dramatically in recent years, and they can be genuinely valuable in a professional workflow. The key word is <em>workflow</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            Using machine translation as a starting draft that a qualified professional then reviews, corrects, and verifies is a common and legitimate approach in the language industry. What it produces is still PVT — because a professional verified it. Using machine translation output without professional review, on the other hand, produces UVT. For high-visibility website content, this creates real risk: undetected errors, culturally inappropriate phrasing, and content that search engines may rank lower because it doesn't read naturally to native speakers.

                                Even the best machine translation systems don't have a reliable sense of what will resonate with a specific audience in a specific cultural context. They don't know your brand voice. They can't anticipate what a potential customer in Mexico City is actually searching for, or how a healthcare patient in Miami would want to be addressed. Professional translators bring all of this — and that's what makes the difference between content that ranks and content that doesn't.
