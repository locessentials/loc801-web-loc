                            What is Traditional SEO?
                        </h2>
                        <p class="intro-text">
                            Traditional SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of improving websites to make them appear in high positions in search engine results pages (SERPs). When someone searches for information on Google, Bing, or other search engines, SEO helps determine which websites appear at the top of those results.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            For localization professionals, understanding SEO is crucial because translated content needs to be discoverable by your target audience. A perfectly localized website serves little purpose if search engines cannot find it or if it ranks poorly in search results. Good SEO practices ensure that your multilingual content reaches the people who are searching for it.
                        </p>

                        <p class="conclusion-text">
                            Traditional SEO focuses on optimizing content for search engines like Google, which use complex algorithms to crawl, index, and rank web pages. This differs from newer approaches like LLM discoverability (which we'll cover later), but the foundational principles remain essential for any web presence.

                            How Search Engines Work
                        </h2>
                        <p class="intro-text">
                            Understanding how search engines work is fundamental to creating content that can be found. Search engines don't magically know about every website—they follow a systematic process to discover, understand, and rank content.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Search Engine Market Share</h3>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            While Google dominates globally with approximately 90% market share, different regions favor different search engines. In the United States and Canada, about 6% use Bing and 4% use Yahoo. In Russia, Yandex commands 45% of the market. In China, Baidu leads with 65% market share. Privacy-oriented engines like DuckDuckGo serve niche audiences who prioritize data protection.
                        </p>

                        <p class="regular-text-w-top-padding">
                            For localization work, this means you need to research which search engines your target audience actually uses. While we focus primarily on Google in this course (as the market leader), optimizing for regional search engines may be necessary depending on your markets.

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">The Three Components of Search Engines</h3>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            Search engines consist of three main parts:
                        </p>

                        <div class="definition-box">
                            <h4>1. Crawlers (also called spiders or bots)</h4>
                            <p>Automated programs that travel the web 24/7, following links from page to page. Think of them as explorers mapping the internet, collecting content like text, images, videos, and news items. They save the HTML version of each page they visit.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="definition-box">
                            <h4>2. The Index</h4>
                            <p>A massive database where search engines store information about every page they've crawled. This index is updated whenever the crawler revisits a site and finds new or changed content. How often Google's crawler visits your site depends on how important Google deems your site and how frequently you update it.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="definition-box">
                            <h4>3. The Algorithm</h4>
                            <p>The complex system that takes data from the index and calculates which pages best match a user's search query. The algorithm considers hundreds of factors to determine the ranking order shown on search engine results pages (SERPs). While the exact algorithm is secret, extensive testing and Google's own communications help us understand important ranking factors.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">How Search Engines Find Your Site</h3>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            For a search engine to discover your website, there must first be a link to your site from another website that the search engine already knows. Following that link leads to the first crawler session and the first save in the index. Think of indexed sites as a network—crawlers need a road (link) to reach new sites.
                        </p>

                        <p class="regular-text-w-top-padding">
                            This is why links are so important for SEO. Both internal links (from one part of your website to another) and external links (from other websites to yours) have tremendous effects on search engine rankings. The effect can be positive or negative depending on whether the links make sense contextually.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">The Importance of Links</h3>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            Search engines use links to determine how important a page is. Pages with more links pointing to them are generally considered more important. However, not all links are equal—links from websites that themselves have many external links are generally more valuable than links from small websites with few external links.
                        </p>

                        <div class="callout-box">
                            <p><strong>Localization Insight:</strong> When creating multilingual sites, proper linking between language versions and maintaining link value across languages becomes a technical SEO consideration. When creating multilingual sites, proper linking between language versions and maintaining link value across languages becomes a technical SEO consideration. This involves implementing hreflang tags to tell search engines which language versions of a page exist, and ensuring that internal links preserve SEO authority when users switch between languages.</p>

                        <p class="intro-text">
                            Holistic SEO means looking at the bigger picture rather than focusing on isolated tactics. It's about creating the best possible website for your users, knowing that search engines want to show users the best results.

                            SEO factors can be divided into two categories:
                        </p>

                        <div class="definition-box">
                            <h4>On-Page Factors</h4>
                            <p>Elements on your own website that you can control, including site structure, content quality, page speed, technical code quality, keyword usage, and mobile optimization.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="definition-box">
                            <h4>Off-Page Factors</h4>
                            <p>Elements outside your website that influence your ranking, such as links from other websites, social media attention, brand mentions, and other marketing activities.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Google's Mission and Your Strategy</h3>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            Google's mission is to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." To achieve this, Google must show users the best possible results for their searches—otherwise people would stop using Google.
                        </p>

                        <p class="regular-text-w-top-padding">
                            This means that if your website genuinely is the best option for users searching for your topic, Google wants to rank it highly. Your goal should be to build and maintain the best possible website. Ranking in Google will improve over time if your website is of extremely high quality and truly serves user needs.

                            Some tactics try to exploit loopholes in search algorithms to rank higher than deserved. These include:

                            <h4>⚠️ Keyword Stuffing</h4>
                            <p>Filling pages with keywords or numbers that appear out of context, often in lists or groups. Some sites even use white text to hide keywords from users while still exposing them to search engines. This violates search engine guidelines.</p>

                        <div class="warning-box">

                            <p>Paying for links or exchanging free products for links to artificially boost rankings. Search engines have become sophisticated at detecting unnatural link patterns and will penalize sites that engage in these practices.</p>

                        <p class="regular-text">
                            Google's algorithm updates like Panda (2011) and Penguin (2012) specifically targeted these manipulative tactics. Sites using such tricks were heavily penalized and lost their rankings. As algorithms become more sophisticated, short-term tactics become increasingly ineffective and risky.

                        <p class="intro-text">
                            Over 50% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices—and in many markets, mobile usage exceeds desktop usage by a significant margin. This means ensuring your website provides an excellent mobile experience is not optional; it's essential for both user satisfaction and search engine rankings.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Mobile-First Indexing</h3>
                        <p class="regular-text">
                            In 2018, Google switched to mobile-first indexing. This means Google primarily uses the mobile version of your site for indexing and ranking—even when users are searching on desktop computers. If your site doesn't work well on mobile, your search rankings will suffer across all devices.
                        </p>

                        <p class="regular-text">
                            You can check how your site appears on different devices using the browser Developer Tools you learned about in Topic 3. Here's how:

                                <li>Click "Inspect" to open Developer Tools</li>
                                <li>Click the "Toggle device toolbar" icon (it looks like a phone and tablet overlapping) or press Ctrl+Shift+M (Cmd+Shift+M on Mac)</li>
                                <li>Use the dropdown at the top to select different device types (iPhone, iPad, various Android phones, tablets)</li>
                                <li>Test how your content reflows, whether buttons are tappable, and if text remains readable</li>

                        <p class="regular-text">
                            CSS media queries allow you to apply different styles based on device characteristics like screen width. This is how responsive design works—the same HTML content styled differently for different screen sizes.
                        </p>

                        <div class="code-example">
                            <pre><code>/* Default styles for desktop */
.container {

}

/* Styles for tablets and smaller */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        padding: 15px;
    }
    
    .navigation {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}

/* Styles for mobile phones */
@media (max-width: 420px) {
    .container {

                            The <code>@media</code> property lets you define breakpoints where your layout changes. Common breakpoints include:

                            <p>The LocCompetencies project you completed in Topic 4 was not optimized for mobile viewing. Use the Toggle Device Toolbar in Chrome to see how it looks on a phone. Then try working with a GAI chatbot to create responsive styles that make it work well on tablets (max-width: 768px) and mobile phones (max-width: 420px).</p>

                                <li>Ensure buttons are large enough to tap with a finger (at least 44x44 pixels)</li>
                                <li>Stack elements vertically on small screens rather than side-by-side</li>
                                <li>Adjust padding and margins to work with limited screen width</li>

                                    CTR measures the percentage of people who click on your search result after seeing it. A higher CTR indicates that your title tags and meta descriptions are compelling and relevant to search queries. Industry benchmarks vary by position, but the top result typically achieves a CTR between 25-35%.
                                </p>

                                    Bounce rate represents the percentage of visitors who leave your site after viewing only one page. While not directly a ranking factor, high bounce rates may signal that your content doesn't match user intent or fails to engage visitors effectively.
                                </p>

                                    However, context matters. A high bounce rate on a contact information page may be perfectly acceptable if users found what they needed. Conversely, a high bounce rate on a product page or article suggests users aren't finding the content valuable or relevant.

                                    Dwell time refers to how long a user stays on your page after clicking through from search results. Longer dwell times typically indicate that users find your content valuable and engaging, which can positively influence rankings over time.
