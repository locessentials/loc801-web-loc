                            In this activity, you'll identify several types of translatable elements on Coca-Cola's website that you would work with as a web translator. You'll examine how global brands make choices about standardization versus adaptation, analyzing both the visible content and the hidden technical decisions that shape user experiences across different markets.

                        </h2>
                        <p class="intro-text">
                            A language selector might seem simple, but this example reveals the complex technical, linguistic, and political decisions involved in effective localization.

                            <h3 class="resource-title">Selector Location in Footer & Regional Localization Complexities</h3>
                            <p class="resource-content">
                                In Coca-Cola's website footer, there's a language selector through which users can choose a region to view content in that region's lingua franca.
                            </p>
                            <img src="../assets/images/Coca-Cola-footer-language-picker.png" 
                                 alt="Coca-Cola website footer in Spanish showing region selector with 'México' selected" 
                                 class="image">

                            <img src="../assets/images/Coca-Cola-regions-language-picker.png" 
                                 alt="Coca-Cola location selector dropdown menu showing global regions organized by geographic area" 
                                 class="image">
                            <p class="resource-content">
                                Interestingly, when clicking on the selector, the content appears in English rather than Spanish. The location selector therefore needs translation in order to complete the localization to Mexican Spanish.
                            </p>
                            <p class="resource-content">
                                Not only that, the location selector also reflects bias toward mainland China. In the screenshot, I've selected "Greater China & Mongolia," but Taiwan doesn't appear as a location within this region. This may be because mainland China doesn't recognize Taiwan's statehood, although Taiwan considers itself an independent country.
                            </p>
                            <p class="resource-content">
                                In terms of the localized website language, this makes a significant difference. If users from Taiwan access China's localization, the content will be presented in Simplified Chinese, while Taiwanese read and write in Traditional Chinese.

                                Above, we covered how Coca-Cola's location selecter implies support for Mainland China's political stance toward Taiwan. This could reflect the political stance of the company. Unfortunately, it's equally likely that no one thought at all about the implications of the design of the language selector. This would not be the first time that Coca-Cola failed to recognize the political implications of their content.

                                A prominent example of the importance of cultural sensitivity in localization is <a href="https://remezcla.com/lists/culture/timeline-coca-cola-mexico-indigenous-ad-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="inline-link">Coca-Cola Mexico's 2015 controversy with its 'Open Your Heart' campaign</a>, where an ad intended to show inclusion provoked strong backlash from the Mixe community in Oaxaca due to its colonialist and stereotypical perspective. The campaign had to be withdrawn and the company was forced to publicly apologize, demonstrating how even the largest brands can suffer significant reputational damage when they don't adequately consider local cultural context in their marketing and communication strategies.

                                A more recent example of the influence of politics on localization is U.S. President Donald Trump's decision that the Gulf of Mexico should be called the Gulf of America. <a href="https://observer.com/2025/02/apple-google-map-users-gulf-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="inline-link">Google and Apple Maps</a> now show the name 'Gulf of America' for this body of water to users located in the United States and 'Gulf of Mexico' to users in Mexico. This case demonstrates how localization decisions are sometimes directly affected by politics.
