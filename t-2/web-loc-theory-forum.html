                            In this lesson, we'll read and respond to both practical and theoretical questions relevant to website localization. The primary reading is <strong><a href="../ref/Crespo_WebLocProcess_2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="inline-link">"Website Localization" by Anthony Pym</a></strong>, which examines the gap between localization ideals as cultural adaptation and the industrial reality where translators work with decontextualized fragments.

                            The additional readings included at the end of this lesson offer complementary perspectives: "The Web Localization Process: From GILT to Web Usability" by Miguel Jiménez-Crespo presents a detailed breakdown of 32 steps in the localization process, from initial preparation to quality control, while "Website Localization: A Comprehensive Guide to Success in 10 Steps" by Palash offers a contemporary practical guide focused on strategic planning. Together, these readings will help you understand both theoretical foundations and practical aspects of web localization.

                                "One should nevertheless be careful not to confuse this sense of 'localization' as adaptation with the nature of communication in the localization industry as a whole. As noted above, the automatic extraction of translatables, together with the nature of ongoing maintenance work, means that much translation is performed on decontextualized fragments, where quite literalist equivalence strategies become far more common than anything approaching adaptation. Thanks to the technologies, the localization industry commonly requires its translators to work at the level of quite restrictive phrase-to-phrase equivalence, with constant respect for pre-established glossaries."

                                Pym describes an industrial reality where "localization" is frequently reduced to decontextualized translation of text fragments, with little room for the creative adaptation the term originally implies.

                                "Since electronic texts are easily modified, particularly as compared with print technologies, websites are frequently changed and updated. Much translation work thus does not start from the whole site but is limited to the modifications or updates… [T]he translating then takes place on decontextualized segments. The translator does not have easy access to information about the communication act, but the nature of the work does not always require such access."

From there, the files are usually sent to freelancers, mostly in formats requiring free or cheap versions of translation-memory suites and probably accompanied by no special information on the nature of the website concerned."

                                "Hybrid strategies are further enhanced by the use of hyperlinks. For example, a print-media translator might be faced with the dilemma of how to explain cultural realia. Faced with something like 'Australian-rules football', do you add a few phrases to note that it is not like soccer and not like American football? Or a footnote? Or just leave it as such? A website translator, however, could theoretically link the term to as much information as the user could possibly want, perhaps in one of the language versions of Wikipedia, in effect allowing the user to determine the extent of explanation. Some of the classical translation dilemmas might thus be resolved quite simply. In common practice, however, few translators are allowed responsibility for such things as adding hyperlinks."

                                "Perhaps the most significant consequence of use patterns is that the design of the webpage is at least as important as its linguistic content. Nielson's studies with eye-tracking (2006) suggest that English-language users start at the top-left and look across the page horizontally in one or two sweeps, and then skim down the page vertically, giving an F-shaped pattern."

                                In the article, Pym discusses patterns that English-language users tend to follow when viewing and interacting with websites. Do some research: What patterns do Spanish-language users tend to follow when viewing and interacting with websites? How do these patterns compare to those described by Pym for English-language users? In the likely event that you find no research on the reading patterns of Spanish-language users, discuss the implications of designing for English-reading patterns when localizing for Spanish-speaking audiences.

A good deal of the tasks assigned to translators result from that blanket logic: all users in a particular country will need and want their information in the national language(s) of that country."

                                "Research on these issues sometimes makes reference to parameters that are presumed to typify entire cultures, much of it going back to Geert Hofstede's huge survey of IBM employees between 1967 and 1973, originally allowing numerical data to be synthesized for 40 countries (see Hofstede 1980, Hofstede and Hofstede 2005). Hofstede presents tables like the Uncertainty Avoidance Index or the Individualism Index, where different countries occupy different positions: the United States rates high on the individualism scale, for example, whereas Asian countries are at the bottom of that particular list."

                                Pym points out two contradictory tendencies in web localization: on one hand, internationalization that aims to create "culture-less" content, and on the other, the tendency to categorize users solely by their nationality and national language.

What problems arise when we reduce our audiences only to their nationality?
