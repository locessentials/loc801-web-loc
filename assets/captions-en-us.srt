00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:04,273
Welcome to this presentation on

2
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:06,191
Navigating Global Markets

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:10,341
From the GILT Framework to 
AI-Enhanced Localization Workflows

4
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:12,654
My name is Alaina Brandt.

5
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,770
For those of you who don’t know me, 
I’m an academic.

6
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:19,415
I’m the founder and 
principal trainer at LocEssentials

7
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:23,408
and I’m
membership secretary of ASTM F43.

8
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:25,726
Here’s our agenda for today.

9
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:30,910
We’ll cover the GILT framework and best 
practices in software internationalization.

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,319
We’ll look at an overview 
of a localization workflow

11
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:39,270
and we’ll take a brief look at translation 
and localization specifications.

12
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:43,868
Next, we’ll consider how 
translation and localization specifications

13
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:48,115
can be automatically integrated 
into workflows using LLMs.

14
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:52,277
Finally, we’ll conclude by acknowledging 
the people who work together

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,667
to make global experiences local.

16
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:59,423
Before diving into localization

17
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:03,244
it’s helpful to first situate 
this concept among related concepts

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,595
that deal with producing multilingual
products for international audiences.

19
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:12,366
Globalization deals with the infrastructure
that enterprises put in place

20
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:14,795
to carry out international operations.

21
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,740
Internationalization is the development 
of software that is culturally neutral

22
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,280
with the localization-ready architecture

23
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:26,445
that can be customized 
to locales during localization.

24
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:31,165
Localization is the adaptation 
of products and services

25
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,460
to specific locales in the world.

26
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:37,467
Translation is the work that’s done 
to render the language

27
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:40,015
of an organization’s communications

28
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:45,146
products and services to the language
variant spoken in a specific locale.

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,348
In translation, words like 
“equivalent” and “accurate”

30
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:54,216
are often used to describe the writing 
that results from translation.

31
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:58,879
However, it’s important to note that 
by virtue of being in a different language

32
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:02,953
aspects of the meaning of the 
source content will be lost

33
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:05,547
and the target language 
will also add meaning

34
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:08,047
that was not present 
in the so-called original.

35
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:14,111
The components of the GILT framework
are interrelated and interdependent

36
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:18,030
since the localization of products 
implies the need to navigate law

37
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:22,741
hire local talent and support users 
at all stages of their customer journey.

38
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:27,276
When working toward global market expansion

39
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,008
globalization and internationalization 
form part of the main highway.

40
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,382
However, some organizations

41
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,711
eager to reach new markets quickly

42
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:40,031
opt to bypass directly to localization

43
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:44,615
and then have to deal with inefficient 
processes that require constant rework

44
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:47,643
inconsistent brand messaging across markets

45
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:51,239
technical challenges in adapting 
products for different locales

46
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:54,944
and higher long-term costs 
due to the need for retrofitting.

47
00:02:55,977 --> 00:03:00,407
While localization strategy shapes 
an effective globalization strategy

48
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:03,965
it is often relegated 
to a downstream process

49
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:05,937
in the product development lifecycle.

50
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:09,815
Localization teams are often 
handed minimum viable

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,492
or fully featured products

52
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,969
that have been validated 
for their original market

53
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,313
but that are not prepared for localization.

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,028
Let’s take software internationalization 
as an example.

55
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:27,853
Key aspects of internationalization to 
ready software for localization includes:

56
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:32,610
Externalizing strings by moving 
all user-facing text out of the code

57
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:34,922
and into separate resource files

58
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,192
and using string IDs in the code
instead of hardcoded text.

59
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:43,376
Ensuring that the application 
uses Unicode encoding

60
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,059
such as UTF-8

61
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,197
to support multiple languages
and character sets.

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,748
Avoiding string concatenation

63
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:54,616
by using parameterized strings 
instead of concatenating fragments

64
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:57,810
as word order can
change in different languages.

65
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:01,816
Allowing for text expansion 
in user interface design

66
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:05,320
as some languages may 
require more space than others.

67
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,271
For dates, times, and numbers

68
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:12,810
using locale-aware data types that can
adjust to different formats.

69
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:16,018
Avoiding the hardcoding of 
cultural assumptions

70
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:18,610
by not assuming specific date formats

71
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:21,254
currency symbols, or sorting orders.

72
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:24,089
Supporting bidirectional text

73
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:27,270
by ensuring that the UI 
can handle both left-to-right

74
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,065
and right-to-left text directions.

75
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:33,584
For operations like sorting 
or case conversion

76
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:37,943
using locale-aware functions 
instead of language-specific ones.

77
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:40,471
Implementing plural rules...

78
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:43,208
Languages have varying plural forms

79
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:46,724
and a plural rule system must 
be used to handle this correctly.

80
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,831
Avoiding hardcoding images with text...

81
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:54,323
Text should be kept separate
from images to allow for easy translation.

82
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,878
Can you spot the
internationalization issues

83
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:02,106
in this code generated
by Claude 3.5 Sonnet?

84
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:06,962
There are concatenation issues in the plus
operations used to combine strings.

85
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:12,646
There is a hardcoded date format of month-
day-year which is not universally used.

86
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:17,137
The dollar symbol is hardcoded, 
which isn’t appropriate for all locales.

87
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:22,128
There is a plural form handling issue 
in the conditional statement at the end.

88
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,265
This simple if-else statement

89
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:28,110
doesn’t account for languages 
with more complex plural rules.

90
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:33,161
Finally, hardcoded string issues 
appear throughout the entire function.

91
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:37,698
All user-facing strings should be 
externalized for translation.

92
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:41,361
As these types of issues pile up

93
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:44,544
that results in a higher
internationalization debt

94
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:48,093
or the accumulation of
internationalization issues

95
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:52,463
that need to be addressed before
effective localization can occur.

96
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,716
Here’s an improved version of the code

97
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:00,043
that addresses the
localization issues in the following ways.

98
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:03,770
String concatenation was 
replaced with the dot format

99
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:06,930
and get text methodologies 
for easier translation.

100
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:11,447
Where we previously had a hardcoded 
date format and currency symbol

101
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:16,148
we’re now using Babel's format date 
and format currency functions

102
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:17,807
which are locale-aware.

103
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,832
We’ve implemented a more 
comprehensive plural form handling

104
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:26,428
that can be more easily translated 
to languages with complex plural rules.

105
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:29,905
The user-facing strings 
are no longer hardcoded

106
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,920
and are instead wrapped 
with the get text function

107
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,712
making them translatable.

108
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:38,369
Also, the locale parameter 
has now been added.

109
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:41,715
The function now accepts a locale string

110
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,496
allowing for easy switching
between different locales.

111
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:49,449
Please note that to use this code, 
we’d need to install Babel.

112
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,547
For a full implementation

113
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:55,375
we’d also need to set up proper
translation files for get text

114
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:59,425
but this code structure allows for
easy integration of translations.

115
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,632
If you’ll allow me one more example 
of an internationalization issue,

116
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:10,917
code also needs to be updated to handle 
name ordering in different languages.

117
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:12,885
For example, in English

118
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,857
the given name comes first

119
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:17,747
and in Chinese
the family name comes first.

120
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,478
Here’s an example of the output of code

121
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:23,561
that has been adapted to
different name ordering conventions

122
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,964
that also shows how the 
greeting itself can be translated.

123
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:32,828
These are all issues that an 
AI coding assistant could be set up

124
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,944
to help localization aware 
programmers to identify

125
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:39,304
to ensure that
software is properly localized.

126
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,170
Let’s move on.

127
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:45,640
Let’s assume that proper globalization and

128
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,566
internationalization frameworks are in place

129
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:50,976
Now, let’s consider localization.

130
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,010
This is a localization workflow model

131
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:56,127
that I’ve taught for about seven years now.

132
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,751
It’s based upon an illustration 
that I recently had published

133
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:02,871
in the Handbook of the Language Industry 
in my chapter called

134
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:07,021
“Translation and Localization 
Project and Process Managers.”

135
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:10,835
Let’s walk through the workflow.

136
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:14,298
In this workflow, 
a client submits a work request.

137
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,850
Specifications, 
or the requirements for work

138
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:20,282
are defined and then the work is quoted.

139
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:23,257
Assuming that the client approves the quote

140
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:25,081
preproduction begins.

141
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:27,403
Resources are put into place.

142
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,473
the project is prepared for production

143
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:32,835
through such steps as
pre-editing the source text

144
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:34,603
gathering terminology

145
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:36,865
carrying out pseudo-translation

146
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,702
to determine where text
expansion or contraction may take place

147
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:44,875
in order to identify where adjustments 
to the overall design may be needed.

148
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,242
The work is passed through

149
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,184
machine and human translation in a
translation environment tool

150
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:55,021
that separates the language for
translation from its packaging

151
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:59,256
whether that packaging be a Word document 
or a website or some other structure.

152
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,342
When the language work is complete

153
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:05,582
the language is reincorporated
back into the design of the product.

154
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,975
In-context and functionality 
checks take place

155
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,818
and then finally the
work is delivered to the client.

156
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:18,270
Now, a guiding principle in my work in 
translation and localization has been

157
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,542
Time investments during 
front end stages yield

158
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,914
yield the greatest efficiencies 
on back end processes.

159
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:29,688
I’ve come to this principle after 
discovering unknowns during localization.

160
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:33,814
For example, Khmer, a language of Cambodia

161
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,470
uses different keyboard configurations 
to produce different fonts.

162
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:41,282
If I need the content to be 
localized into a Unicode font

163
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:45,120
I need to define that requirement 
upfront in specifications

164
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:48,111
to avoid a great deal of 
rework further downstream.

165
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:54,959
So, let’s start at the beginning and 
take a deeper look at specifications.

166
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:59,856
For clarity, we’ll start with a 
working definition of specifications.

167
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:04,615
According to ASTM International,
an international standards body

168
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:06,645
specifications are the

169
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,474
“explicit set of requirements 
to be satisfied by a material

170
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:13,297
product, system, or service.”

171
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,442
Now, specifications are 
important in every industry.

172
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:22,241
Specifications are particularly 
important in translation and localization

173
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:25,320
because quality here is so subjective.

174
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:29,254
If you ask a group of five translators
to translate the same content

175
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,416
no two will produce the same translation

176
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:35,361
and they’ll also have different ideas 
about the quality of each translation

177
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:38,806
With specifications, 
the primary objective is therefore

178
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:43,095
to take this fuzzy idea of 
translation and localization quality

179
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:44,721
and make it objective.

180
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,799
At the end of translation and localization

181
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,824
if we’ve met the requirements 
in the specifications

182
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:52,353
we have achieved quality

183
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:55,544
so long as the specifications 
are accurate and complete.

184
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:59,482
Defining accurate and complete 
specifications is no small matter.

185
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:02,400
Specifications need 
to address the requirements

186
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:05,774
of the requesters of the 
translation and localization services

187
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,266
their end users

188
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,695
and the teams producing the content.

189
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:14,299
Specifications also need 
to make any implicit expectations

190
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:19,637
of the receiving culture that may not be 
obvious to localization producers explicit.

191
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,950
That’s why using standards-based 
specifications is so important

192
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,412
in achieving desired outcomes 
in translation and localization.

193
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,631
Let's discuss the standards-based 
specification template

194
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:38,295
for translation and localization work that 
I've developed over the past seven years.

195
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:42,458
This template is structured 
into various parameter groups.

196
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,982
Project specifics outline the requirements 
for each project in a product line

197
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:51,893
while the remaining parameter groups 
are meant to provide general guidelines

198
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:54,221
applicable across the entire product line.

199
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:59,158
Within these specifications, 
language work - often translation

200
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:04,406
is defined in harmony 
with the definition used by FIT

201
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:08,871
as work performed on the textual aspects 
of the content for rendering.

202
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,200
Within these specifications, design work

203
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,144
i.e. localization, is defined as

204
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,827
work with non-textual aspects 
of the content for rendering.

205
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,594
 According to the MQM framework

206
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:26,930
“Design includes text, paragraph, 
and user interface element formatting

207
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,237
and markup, integration of 
text with graphical elements

208
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:32,824
and overall page or window layout.”

209
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:38,455
Okay, let’s take a closer look 
at a few of the specific parameters

210
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,143
collected within the parameter groups 
starting with the product line parameters.

211
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:48,239
 Under product line parameters, 
the verticals for the work are defined.

212
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:52,328
Vertical is a synonym for subject field

213
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:55,251
subject matter, domain, or discipline

214
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:59,551
and refers to the specialized subjects 
encompassed by the content.

215
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:03,824
Defining the verticals of the work 
is an important precursor

216
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:07,410
for determining the terminology 
and linguistic conventions

217
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,457
that should be followed within the content.

218
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:14,193
Under legal and confidentiality concerns

219
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,659
important parameters are defined like

220
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:22,165
whether or not moral rights will 
be granted to LSPs like translators

221
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,479
and translation agencies.

222
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,446
According to the U.S. Copyright Office

223
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:30,570
within copyright law, 
the term moral rights

224
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,046
“refers to certain noneconomic rights 
that are considered personal to an author”

225
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,618
including one
“the right of attribution” or

226
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:42,144
“the right of an author to be credited 
as the author of their work,”

227
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,339
and two “the right of integrity”

228
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:48,292
or “the right to prevent prejudicial 
distortions to the[ir] work”.

229
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:53,687
In the U.S., translators typically don’t 
receive moral rights over their work

230
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,164
but this can vary in other countries.

231
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:00,783
For instance, federal law in Mexico 
grants these rights to translators.

232
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,935
 Navigating differences in 
international federal law

233
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,227
is an important aspect of 
translation and localization work.

234
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:14,260
Data security and protection form another 
vital component of our specifications.

235
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,963
Given that about 75% of 
translation work is outsourced

236
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:23,234
it’s crucial to define how data 
will be accessed and protected.

237
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:27,683
This is especially important 
when dealing with confidential content.

238
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,552
When it comes to language parameters

239
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:35,688
we go beyond simply specifying 
the language and variant.

240
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,057
We go deeply into the demographics and

241
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:42,104
experiential background 
of the target audience.

242
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:44,607
This detailed understanding

243
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:50,123
allows us to make appropriate terminology 
and stylistic choices in translation.

244
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,592
I also want to emphasize the importance 
of establishing parameters

245
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:57,672
around the language aspect 
of localization work.

246
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:01,537
While it may have been 
undervalued in recent history

247
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:06,523
language is the primary way people 
communicate and engage with brands.

248
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:10,851
Neglecting this component can 
contribute to user experience debt

249
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:14,224
potentially leading to 
decreased user satisfaction

250
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:17,584
higher churn rates, 
and negative brand perception.

251
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,985
It’s worth noting that the process of 
establishing these specifications

252
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,133
especially when onboarding 
new language service providers

253
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,254
can take months.

254
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:31,222
This is due to the complexity 
of addressing legal concerns

255
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,508
setting up data security systems

256
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:37,582
and establishing the additional necessary 
infrastructure for carrying out work.

257
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:42,096
By carefully considering all these 
aspects in our specifications

258
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:46,671
we ensure that our localization efforts 
truly speak to the intended audience

259
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:51,025
maintaining brand integrity across 
different markets and cultures.

260
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,900
Let’s move on now to 
thinking about the reality of

261
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:59,576
the translation and localization 
production floor.

262
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:04,026
If I’m working as a project manager 
for an organization with a heavy volume

263
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:06,657
I do not have the capacity to

264
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,049
fully review all of the content 
that’s being sent for localization

265
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:14,826
in order to develop 
robust project specifications.

266
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:20,038
So now I’ll discuss how generative AI 
can be incorporated to address this

267
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,480
and other manual processes that 
we have in translation and localization.

268
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:29,236
You’re likely familiar
with the software wizards

269
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,313
that guide users through
the configuration process.

270
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:37,756
A specifications wizard powered by 
generative AI can act similarly

271
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:41,850
by analyzing the content 
for translation and localization

272
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,098
to produce a more automated report

273
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:47,926
of the work parameters that will define 
the scope and objectives for the work.

274
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,220
A basic T&L Specifications Wizard

275
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:54,814
can be achieved by prompting 
a generative AI assistant.

276
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,268
For example, in this image

277
00:16:57,293 --> 00:17:01,575
a generative AI assistant has been prompted
to produce a specifications report

278
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:05,750
that defines parameters like the 
language variant of the source text

279
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,449
the primary vertical

280
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,245
the author type, the content type

281
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:13,713
and the readability level 
when a user uploads a text.

282
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:20,602
Challenges in system prompt for producing 
this type of an automated report

283
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:25,318
including defining a standardized ontology 
of the all of the types of content

284
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:28,047
that humans and machines produce

285
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:30,390
and that are translated and localized.

286
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:33,810
Content spans many text types

287
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:37,643
from blog posts, 
to user generated content, to reports

288
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,823
statements, speeches, and articles

289
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,193
and much, much more

290
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:44,851
each text type having
its own distinct conventions

291
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,745
that make the text that type.

292
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:48,664
To illustrate

293
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:51,489
patents use a particular language 
to describe inventions

294
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:53,723
that is neither too broad or too narrow.

295
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,698
If the language is too broad

296
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,159
no new invention is actually described.

297
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:02,289
If the language is too narrow, 
the invention is not fully protected.

298
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:07,096
Another example of a text type is 
a fortune from a fortune cookie

299
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:10,097
where philosophical quotes 
and encouraging predictions

300
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,321
that meet strict 
character limitations are expected.

301
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:16,692
Any ontology of
human communication and knowledge

302
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:20,010
needs to be modeled using 
controlled language in a standardized way

303
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,488
to make the information easily retrievable

304
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,425
and more importantly 
actionable later downstream.

305
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:30,446
Any system prompt therefore needs 
to strategically model complex systems

306
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:32,929
within the limitations of 
the context window

307
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:37,425
of information that generative AI systems 
can hold in their working memory

308
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:42,605
when analyzing the prompt and the input 
content to produce an automated report.

309
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:48,376
Now it’s one thing to produce 
an automated report.

310
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:53,575
It’s another thing to make the information 
collected in the specifications actionable.

311
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:57,533
Ideally, the automations 
we’d want to put in place

312
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:00,542
include routing the information 
collected through the wizard

313
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:03,492
to downstream processes in the workflow.

314
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:08,988
We’d want the information collected 
to be used to automatically carry out

315
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:11,716
and resolve typical 
translation readiness check issues

316
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:13,685
associated with the content.

317
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:18,580
We’d want the information to be 
automatically routed to expertise matching

318
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:23,552
in selecting the best available 
translators and MT engines for the work.

319
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,775
We’d want the information collected 
to be used to make recommendations

320
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,893
to clients about 
the service level for their work…

321
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,531
and tie the parameters 
to costs and timelines

322
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,531
in order to produce 
nearly instantaneous quotes.

323
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:42,180
We’d want the information collected to be 
used to automatically configure workflows…

324
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:47,894
and to automatically create projects with 
the desired configuration in the TEnT.

325
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:53,447
We’d want the information to be 
automatically routed into the style guides

326
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,470
used to guide machine and human translation

327
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:00,715
and into the final sanity checklists 
that are carried out to confirm that

328
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:05,231
deliverables meet the requirements 
set out in the specifications.

329
00:20:06,065 --> 00:20:08,869
We’d want to do all this so that 
we’re helping our clients

330
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,653
whether internal or external 
to our organization

331
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,036
to meet their KPIs

332
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,889
whether those KPIs are increased engagement

333
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:18,952
a reduced number of 
customer support requests

334
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:22,874
increased sales in the 
target market or something else.

335
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,655
Being able to execute on automations 
in translation and localization

336
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,204
through a system of this kind

337
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,247
in a way that adds value 
to globalization strategy is doable

338
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:38,983
and it requires a global network of 
skilled talent performing in roles like

339
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,791
machine learning, software development

340
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:44,557
product management, project management

As we embrace the challenges and

348
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:19,121
let us remember that effective 
translation and localization

349
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:23,639
are not just about going through 
the motions to render and redesign content.

and creating truly global experiences.

By leveraging the power of 
technology and human expertise

352
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,013
we can break down language barriers, 
connect with diverse audiences

353
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,834
and drive meaningful 
growth on a global scale.

354
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:44,254
The future of localization is 
not just about adapting content.

355
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:49,054
It’s about crafting local experiences 
that resonate across borders and cultures

356
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:51,844
ultimately bringing 
our world closer together.

357

Thank you for your time.
